sylvie v0.5.0

i missed you. did you miss me, too?



unfinished concept (and won't be worked on for a while!) currently only has the first conversation, and will loop from the beginning with every reload/boot.

self indulgent writing. i dont think this version of them as a ghost is too interesting since i think the pacing, comprehension, and hook of the first conversation can be better. i think im alright with this little exercise though it was fun :)

feel free to watch them talk. imagine the movie they're watching is your screen :)
